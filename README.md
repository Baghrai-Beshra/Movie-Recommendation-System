## Movie Recommender System
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System, a web application built with Streamlit. This project uses a machine learning model to recommend movies based on user input and provides additional details like runtime, cast, and posters fetched from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. You can also explore download links for recommended movies.

### Features
🎥 Movie Recommendations: Recommends five movies similar to the selected movie.
🖼️ Movie Posters: Displays the poster of each recommended movie.
⏳ Runtime: Shows the duration of the movie in hours and minutes.
🌟 Top Cast: Lists the top 5 cast members of each recommended movie.
📥 Download Link: Provides a link to download movies.
📞 Contact Information: Displays a call option for additional assistance.
